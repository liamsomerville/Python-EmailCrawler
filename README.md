# Python-EmailCrawler
A simple python crawler that looks for emails, it stays on its TLD and wont deviate.

Theres a debug mode to allow you to see whats happening - Just set "DEBUG = True"



Plans for the Future
 - Multithreading
 - Count SSLErrors
 - Accept input arguments instead of hard coding
 - write outputs to files
